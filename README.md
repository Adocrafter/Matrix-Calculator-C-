# Matrix Calculator
_Custom matrix calculator made in C++ which supports calculating more than 2
matrices in a singe input. This calculator also supports expressions like addition, subtraction, invers, transponsing matrix, inversing matrix and multiplication._

## Setup
In order to use this project all you need to do is download the files and use any text editor to modify them.
In order to run this program you will need any code  editor with capable compiler.
## How to use?
To use this program, you need to run it on your desired code editor with capablle compiler

## How to input matrices?
In order for program to recognise matrix, you would need to input it using this form:
```sh
[1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9]
```
In order to inverse matrix you can do that by typing:
```sh
[1 2;3 4]^-1
```
Same goes for transponsing matrix:
```sh
[1 2;3 4]^-T
```
Finally to do operations on matrices like addition, multiplication, division and other already mentioned, you can do that following this example:
```sh
[1 2; 3 4] + [3 4;2 1]^-1 * [3 6;3 9]^T
```
